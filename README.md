# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I'm super excited to get a solid grasp of these logical processes and workflows, and I want to reach a point where using them is like second nature. I decided to create this web guide the way I did because it felt like a great method for processing info while also practicing what I was learning. I have ADHD, and putting together this study guide was awesome because I got the opportunity to code as well as keep my brain active while tackling pages of instructional text. I've managed to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with proper Git workflow, and now I've got this web study guide that I can tweak and design all by myself.

## Usage

Use is fairly straightforward, there are four sections, one on each (HTML, CSS, GIT, and JAVASCRIPT). Most sections go into further detail on things that are pretty key to remember. There are different cards for each section that outline the content and make it easier to look at, and visual diagrams as you go to help emphasize some of the points. The "types" section explanation I figured would be helpful to have the entire article, so until further features are added to collapse the images (or even better, put them into a scrollbox), it is a bit of a stretch that you need to scroll past. Aside from that, I have done my best to lay it out nicely, and include information that I think someone with my experience would want to remember.
