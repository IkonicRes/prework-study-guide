        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is used to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>Whereas HTML stricly handles structure and content, CSS defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout and organization</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a page using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
          <h3>Inline CSS</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
            <li>Inline styles let you change how one thing looks on a webpage by putting a special code right next to it. This is good for making fast and lasting changes, but it's not very flexible. For a lot of changes at once, it takes more work than using the other methods.</li>
            <li>An example of inline CSS is using the style attribute to change the color of a single h1 heading: < h1 style="color:red;">Prework Study Guide < /h1></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Internal CSS Style Sheet</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Internal style sheets can include CSS ules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file, but the rules only apply to that page.</li>
            <li>You can configure CSS classes and ID's, whcih are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. A single change will affect all tagged elements.</li>
            <li>This code when put in the head ensures that all "h1" elements will be red.
                 h1 {
              color: red;
            }</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>External CSS Style Sheet</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
            <li>This allows you to keep all your CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier</li>
            <li>When using External SS, we link the file using a < link > element placed in the HTML's head like so:  < link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" /></li>
            <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <img class="Diagram" src="./assets/CSS_Diagram_01.png", alt="CSS_Diagram_01">
          <li><b>Selector: </b> defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
          <li><b>Declarations: </b>contain two important components, the CSS property we want to apply, and the value of the property.</li>
          <li><b>margin: </b>indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element; 0 means no extra space around the element</li>
          <li><b>padding: </b>often confused with margin, but not the same. Adds space around the content <b>inside</b> an element. When you increase padding, it actually makes the whole element bigger. Padding is located inside element, whereas margin is a transparent buffer outside the element.</li>
          <img class="Diagram" src="./assets/CSS_Box_Model_Diagram.png", alt="CSS_Box_Model_Diagram">
          <li><b>"*" selector:</b> applies the rule to all of the elements visible on the page. * is a Wildcard symbol.</li>
          <li>You can apply rules to multiple selectors by separating them with a comma like so:<b> header,
            footer {
                width: 100%;
                height: 120px;
                background-color: blue;
                color: white;
            }</b></li>
          <li><b>img</b> Selectors with a display property that is assigned with the block value will assign each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li>When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file. To do this, we will use the HTML < link > element.</li>
          <li>For this project, we would need to add this to the head section of the html file. <b>< link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css" ></b></li>
          <li>the <b>< link ></b> element creates the connection to the external file, the <b>ref</b> attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked resource, and the <b>href</b> attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</li>
          <img class="Diagram" src="/assets/CSS_Class_Example.png" alt="CSS_Class_Example">
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>The first declaration addresses the width of the element at 80% of the available width.</li>
          <li>The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.</li>
          <li>The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.</li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. In our example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). We haven’t defined the blur or spread radius here, but you’ll learn more about this in time. We’ve used an HTML hexadecimal code to define the color.</li>
          <li>We have declared all the property assignments for the class selector, .card, and made sure the class attribute, card, has also been assigned to the correct < section > elements in the markup</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git add -A: adds the changed files in our working dir to the staging area of Git</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is the tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive, and was invented by Brendan Eich</li>
          <li><b>Control Flow:</b> the order in which a computer executes code in a JavaScript file. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>We place the script element near the bottom of the HTML file because the browser reads code in the order it appears in the file. If the JavaScript loads first and it is supposed to affect the HTML that hasn't loaded yet, there could be problems. Placing JavaScript near the bottom of an HTML page is one way to accommodate this dependency.</li>
          <img class="DiagramThin" src="/assets/Diagram_js_Hello_world.png" alt="Hello_World_JavaScript">
          <li>The function querySelector() grabs a reference, in this case to our heading, and then stores it in a variable called myHeading. Similar to CSS selectors, when we want to do something to an element, we need to select it first. This code then sets the heading text content to "Hello world!"</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:</li>
          <center>let myVariable;</center>
          </br>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have semicolons at the end of each statement. There are other rules for when we should and shouldn't use semicolons.</li>
          <li>You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some restrictions, like built-in names.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have problems in your code, check the case!</li>
          <li>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:</li>
          <center>myVariable = "Bob";</center>
          </br>
          <li>Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:</li>
          <center>let myVariable = "Bob";</center>
          </br>
          <li>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:</li>
          <center>myVariable;</center>
          </br>
          <li>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:</li>
          <center>let myVariable = "Bob";</br>myVariable = "Steve";</center>
          </br>
          <li>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types:</li>
          <img class="DiagramGiant" src="/assets/Diagram_js_types.png" alt="JavaScript_Types">
          <li>Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image gallery.</li>
          <li>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:</li>
          <img class="DiagramThin" src="/assets/Diagram_js_comment_example.png" alt="JavaScript_Comment_Example">
          <li>If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:</li>
          <img class="DiagramThin" src="/assets/Diagram_js_comment_single.png" alt="JavaScript_Single_Comment_Example">
          <li>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). In the following table, you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in the JavaScript console.</li>
          <img class="DiagramGiant" src="/assets/Diagram_js_operators_A.png" alt="JavaScript_Operators_Diagram_A">
          <img class="DiagramGiant" src="/assets/Diagram_js_operators_B.png" alt="JavaScript_Operators_Diagram_B">
          <li>Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the if...else statement. For example:</li>
          <img class="Diagram" src="./assets/Diagram_js_conditional.png" alt="Diagram_js_conditional">
          <li>The expression inside the if () is the test. This uses the strict equality operator (as described above) to compare the variable iceCream with the string chocolate to see if the two are equal. If this comparison returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of code—after the else statement—runs instead.</li>
          <li>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions. For example:</li>
          <img class="Diagram" src="/assets/Diagram_js_functions.png" alt="Javascript_Function_Diagram">
          <li>These functions, document.querySelector and alert, are built into the browser. If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parentheses— () —it is likely a function. Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</li>
          <li>For example, the alert() function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string as an argument to tell the function what message to display.</li>  
          <li>You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function which takes two numbers as arguments and multiplies them:</li>  
          <img class="Diagram" src="/assets/Diagram_js_multiply_function.png" alt="Javascript_Multiply_function">
          <li>Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following into your console, then click on the current webpage:</li>  
          <img class="DiagramThin" src="/assets/Diagram_js_click_event_example.png" alt="Javascript_click_event_example">
          <li>There are a number of ways to attach an event handler to an element. Here we select the <html> element. We then call its addEventListener() function, passing in the name of the event to listen to ('click') and a function to run when the event happens. </li>  
          <li>The function we just passed to addEventListener() here is called an <i>anonymous function</i>, because it doesn't have a name. There's an alternative way of writing anonymous functions, which we call an arrow function. An arrow function uses () => instead of function (): </li>  
          <img class="DiagramThin" src="/assets/Diagram_js_click_event_example_arrow_version.png" alt="Javascript_click_event_example_arrow_function">
          <h3>Adding an image changer<h3>
            <h4>In this section, you will learn how to use JavaScript and DOM API features to alternate the display of one of two images. This change will happen as a user clicks the displayed image.</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose an image you want to feature on your example site. Ideally, the image will be the same size as the image you added previously, or as close as possible.</li>
                <li>Save this image in your images folder.</li>
                <li>Rename the image firefox2.png.</li>
                <li>Add the following JavaScript code to your main.js file. </li>
                <img class="Diagram" src="/assets/Diagram_js_image_switcher.png" alt="Javascript_Image_Switcher_Example">
                <li>Save all files and load index.html in the browser. Now when you click the image, it should change to the other one.</li>
            </ol>
            This is what happened. You stored a reference to your "img" element in myImage. Next, you made its onclick event handler property equal to a function with no name (an "anonymous" function). So every time this element is clicked:
            </br>
            </br>
          <ol>
              <li>The code retrieves the value of the image's src attribute.</li>
              <li>The code uses a conditional to check if the src value is equal to the path of the original image: </li>
              <ol>
                <li>If it is, the code changes the src value to the path of the second image, forcing the other image to be loaded inside the "img" element.</li>
                <li>If it isn't (meaning it must already have changed), the src value swaps back to the original image path, to the original state.</li>
              </ol>
          </ol>
          <h3>Adding a personalized welcome message</h3>
          Next, let's change the page title to a personalized welcome message when the user first visits the site. This welcome message will persist. Should the user leave the site and return later, we will save the message using the Web Storage API. We will also include an option to change the user, and therefore, the welcome message.
          <ol>
            <li>In index.html, add the following line just before the "script" element:</li>
            <img class="DiagramThin" src="/assets/Diagram_js_welcome_message_A.png" alt="Welcome_Message_Example_A">
            <li>In main.js, place the following code at the bottom of the file, exactly as it is written. This takes references to the new button and the heading, storing each inside variables: </li>
            <img class="DiagramThin" src="/assets/Diagram_js_welcome_message_B.png" alt="Welcome_Message_Example_B">
            <li>Add the following function to set the personalized greeting. This won't do anything yet, but this will change soon. </li>
            <img class="Diagram" src="/assets/Diagram_js_welcome_message_C.png" alt="Welcome_Message_Example_C">
            The setUserName() function contains a prompt() function, which displays a dialog box, similar to alert(). This prompt() function does more than alert(), asking the user to enter data, and storing it in a variable after the user clicks OK. In this case, we are asking the user to enter a name. Next, the code calls on an API localStorage, which allows us to store data in the browser and retrieve it later. We use localStorage's setItem() function to create and store a data item called 'name', setting its value to the myName variable which contains the user's entry for the name. Finally, we set the textContent of the heading to a string, plus the user's newly stored name. 
            </br>
            </br>
            <li>Add the following condition block. We could call this initialization code, as it structures the app when it first loads.</li>
            <img class="Diagram" src="/assets/Diagram_js_welcome_message_D.png" alt="Welcome_Message_Example_D">
            This first line of this block uses the negation operator (logical NOT, represented by the !) to check whether the name data exists. If not, the setUserName() function runs to create it. If it exists (that is, the user set a user name during a previous visit), we retrieve the stored name using getItem() and set the textContent of the heading to a string, plus the user's name, as we did inside setUserName(). 
            </br>
            </br>
            <li>Put this onclick event handler (below) on the button. When clicked, setUserName() runs. This allows the user to enter a different name by pressing the button. </li>
            <img class="DiagramThin" src="/assets/Diagram_js_welcome_message_E.png" alt="Welcome_Message_Example_E">
            When you run the example and get the dialog box that prompts you to enter your user name, try pressing the Cancel button. You should end up with a title that reads Mozilla is cool, null. This happens because—when you cancel the prompt—the value is set as null. Null is a special value in JavaScript that refers to the absence of a value.
            </br>
            </br>
            Also, try clicking OK without entering a name. You should end up with a title that reads Mozilla is cool, for fairly obvious reasons.
            </br>
            </br>
            To avoid these problems, you could check that the user hasn't entered a blank name. Update your setUserName() function to this:
            <img class="Diagram" src="/assets/Diagram_js_welcome_message_F.png" alt="Welcom_Message_Example_F">
            In human language, this means: If myName has no value, run setUserName() again from the start. If it does have a value (if the above statement is not true), then store the value in localStorage and set it as the heading's text.
          </ol>
          <h3>JavaScript data types and data structures</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:</li>
            <img class="DiagramThin" src="/assets/Diagram_js_dynamic_weak_typing_A.png" alt="JavaScript_dynamic_weak_typing_A">
            <li>JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.</li>
            <img class="Diagram" src="/assets/Diagram_js_dynamic_weak_typing_B.png" alt="JavaScript_dynamic_weak_typing_B">
            <li>Implicit coercions is very convenient, but can be a potential footgun if developers didn't intend to do the conversion, or intend to convert in the other direction (for example, string to number instead of number to string). For symbols and BigInts, JavaScript has intentionally disallowed certain implicit type conversions.</li>
          </ul> 
          <h3>Primitive Values</h3> 
          <ul>
            <li>All types except Object define immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language. We refer to values of these types as primitive values.</li>
            <li>All primitive types, except null, can be tested by the typeof operator. typeof null returns "object", so one has to use === null to test for null.</li>
            <li>All primitive types, except null and undefined, have their corresponding object wrapper types, which provide useful methods for working with the primitive values. For example, the Number object provides methods like toExponential(). When a property is accessed on a primitive value, JavaScript automatically wraps the value into the corresponding wrapper object and accesses the property on the object instead. However, accessing a property on null or undefined throws a TypeError exception, which necessitates the introduction of the optional chaining operator.</li>
            <img class="DiagramGiant" src="/assets/Diagram_js_typing_Primitives.png" alt="JavaScript_Primitive_Types">
            The object wrapper classes' reference pages contain more information about the methods and properties available for each type, as well as detailed descriptions for the semantics of the primitive types themselves.

          </ul>
          <li>In JavaScript, to declare a variable, we use the var keyword. After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.

            Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable. In the example involving a container named "shape" that stores a circle, we can express that in JavaScript as follows:</li>
            <center>var shape = "circle";</center>
            </br>
          <li>In this example, "shape" is the name of our container, or variable, and the data it stores is "circle".</li>
          <li>All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li><b>"console.log(topics);"</b> will print to the console the string value of the variable "topics". The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>To link a file named "script.js" to your main html file, add the following code under the "footer" element and above the closing element for "body":</li>
          < s c r i p t src="./assets/script.js"> < /s c r i p t >
          </br>
          <li>Whereas the style.css file is linked within the <head> element, the script.js file is linked within the <body> element.</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all. For example, we can reverse engineer code to set up a conditional statement that lets us alter the control flow so that code executes only if a certain condition is met.</li>
          <li>To create an if statement in JavaScript, we use the same logic and similar syntax, shown in the following code example:</li>
          if (condition) {
          </br>
            // block of code to be executed if condition is true
          </br>}
          </br>
          </br>
          <li>What exactly do we mean by “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>Sometimes we want to provide more conditions than just if. In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition—just like we did in the dishes pseudocode—by using else if, as demonstrated in the following code example:</li>
          if (first condition) {
          </br>
            // block of code to be executed if first condition is true
          </br>
         } else if (second condition) {</br>
            // block of code to be executed if second condition is true</br>
         }
          </br>
          </br>
          <li>The computer will continue through all of the conditions that we list, evaluating whether or not a condition is truthy. Once it finds a condition that is truthy, it will run the code in the curly brackets associated with that condition, and then break out of the if statement.
          </br>
          </br>
          The following is an example of an if statement:</li>
          if (0) {
          </br>
            console.log("I'm 0!")
          </br>
          } else if (null) {
          </br>
            console.log("I'm null!")
          </br>
          } else if (true) {
          </br>
            console.log("I'm true!")
          </br>
          }
          </br>
          </br>
          <li>The 0 and null values are both falsy, so the computer won't execute the code between the proceeding curly brackets. When the computer gets to the truthy value (true), it executes the code in the following line.</li>
          <li>As you can see in the following code block, we can first replace the topics variable with a new variable called topic with a value of HTML, and then we set up an if statement with several conditions.</li>
          var topic = "HTML";
          </br>
          </br>
          if (topic === 'HTML') {
          </br>
            console.log("Let's study HTML!");
          </br>
          } else if (topic === 'CSS') {
          </br>
            console.log("Let's study CSS!");
          </br>
          } else if (topic === 'Git') {
          </br>
            console.log("Let's study Git!");
          </br>
          } else if (topic === 'JavaScript') {
          </br>
            console.log("Let's study JavaScript!");
          </br>
          } else {
          </br>
            console.log('Please try again!');
          </br>
          }
          </br>
          </br>
          <li>Notice that we are using = = = in each condition. The strict equality operator (= = =) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal. The following image shows a visual representation of this concept:</li>
          <img class="Diagram" src="assets/Diagram_js_equality_operator.png" alt="JavaScript_Equality_Operator">
          <li>We are checking to see if the topic variable exactly equals a certain value. It will then run whatever code block corresponds with the condition that the computer evaluates as truthy. If none of the conditions evaluate as truthy, 'Please try again!' will be logged to the console.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name. However, instead of assigning the variable to a single value, we assign the variable to a group of values.</li>
          <li>The following variable declaration demonstrates how we would represent our group of shapes in an array named shapes:</li>
          var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];
          </br>
          </br>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on. Let's look at an example. The following array stores information about a student named Lu, including his name, age, and whether he is currently enrolled:</li>
          var studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true];
          </br>
          </br>
          <li>Notice that only the student's name, "Lu", is surrounded by quotation marks. That is because Lu is a string, and strings need to be contained within quotation marks. Since 54 is a number and true is a Boolean value, no quotation marks are necessary for those values. As you can see, this array contains a string, a number, and a Boolean value.</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types. The array that we will add to our project only contains strings.</li>
          <li>When working with single data items, we simply used the variable name, like shape, to access the stored data, circle, as shown in the following line of code:</li>
          var shape = "circle";
          </br>
          <li>If we used this same approach with our shapes array, it would return the entire array with all the data items in it.</li>
          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>
          <li>If we wanted to access only the triangle, we start with the name of the variable that stores the array, which in our case is shapes. Then we add the index of triangle to the end of the array name in square brackets, as shown in the following line of code:</li>
          shapes[0];
          </br>
          </br>
          <li>In order to see this in action, we should log it in the console, using the following line of code:</li>
          console.log(shapes[0]);
          </br>
          </br>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <li>By using a for loop, we can tell the computer to go through each of the shapes in our array and log them to the console until there are no shapes left. In order to use the for loop, we need the shape's index and the array's length. The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of the array, we declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in the following line of code:</li>
                var x = 0;
                </br>
                </br>
                <li>The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of code:</li>
                x < shapes.length;
                </br>
                </br>
                <li>The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of code:</li>
                x++
                </br>
                </br>
            </ul>
          <li>A for loop starts with—you guessed it—for. So far, our for loop looks like the following code:</li>
          for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
          </br>
            // code block
          </br>
           }
          </br>
          </br>
          <li>Finally, we put the code that we want to be executed for each loop inside curly brackets. In our case, we want each of the items in the shapes array to be logged in the console. In place of an actual index number, however, we can add the variable x from our for loop. Now, each time the code runs, x will increase by 1 and the next array item will log to the console. The following code shows how this is done:</li>
          for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) {
          </br>
            console.log(shapes[x]);
          </br>
           }
          </br>
          </br>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
